# Value Plan – gogoML

This document proposes enhancement opportunities for the gogoML machine
learning sandbox.  Each item is scored using the **ICE** framework to
help prioritise work.

| Opportunity | Impact | Confidence | Effort | ICE | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Comprehensive documentation:** expand the README to cover setup,
  contribution guidelines and usage examples (DONE) | 6 | 8 | 3 | **16.0** | Already implemented in Batch 1. |
| **Project skeleton & CI:** create a modular package structure, add
  basic utilities, tests and a CI workflow (DONE) | 8 | 7 | 5 | **11.2** | Implemented in Batch 1. |
| **Example notebooks:** add Jupyter notebooks demonstrating model
  training, evaluation and visualisation | 6 | 7 | 4 | **10.5** | Provides interactive learning for users. |
| **Pre‑commit hooks:** integrate `black` and `isort` via
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and mention in docs (DONE) | 4 | 9 | 3 | **12.0** | Included in Batch 1. |
| **Issue & PR templates:** add `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and
  `.github/pull_request_template.md` to standardise contributions | 3 | 9 | 2 | **13.5** | Improves collaboration and reduces friction. |
| **Environment management:** document virtual environment creation and
  package installation; consider adding a `pyproject.toml` | 4 | 8 | 4 | **8.0** | Enhances DX but lower impact than above items. |

### Priorities

The next high‑ROI tasks are adding example Jupyter notebooks and
templates for issues and pull requests.  Both have relatively low
effort and will make the repository more approachable for users and
contributors.
